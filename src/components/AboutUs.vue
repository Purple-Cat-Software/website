    Welcome to the site! Let me introduce myself. I am Michiel, founder and developer of Purple Cat Software and the
    projects. The past few years I have used many different kinds of 'productivity tools' some were great. They did what
    they were advertised to do. However, personally I had the need for an 'all-in-one' tool which combined the most used
    functionalities in one application. This resulted in the creation of PurrfectTool.

    Why Purple Cat Software?

    The name is created to combine 2 obvious things together. Namely, purple (favourite colour of myself) and a cat (the
    type of pet I have). It is straightforward and to the point, similar to the software I want to create. The name says
    what it is and the software does what it should do.
